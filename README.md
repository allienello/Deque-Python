This project was on circular double ended queues (deque) using both a circular array and a circular doubly linked list (CDLL) as underlying structures.

This project was for my data structures and algorithms class at university. Areas of the code where it says 'Do not modify' were given by the instructor. Code indicated otherwise by 'Implement below', 'My code below', or 'Modify below' was implemented by me.

Each function I completed had contraints I had to adhere to. This includes runtime and space complexity (as indicate by the docstrings), the skeleton of the function (declaration, parameters, return value), and the overall task or goal.

Using my knowledge on data structures, specifcally circular arrays and CDLLs, I implemented algorithms for each. I also used my course materials (lecture slides and textbooks), as well as LLMs such as chatGPT when I was stuck on certain aspects.

The application problem for this project was written by the instructor. Similar to the rest of the project, I was given the specifications for the function(s) and an explanation of the problem.

//Application Problem//

In an era where Python has been deemed the universal language, a shift occurred in the techno-economic landscape. Python lists were patented by the Grand Coalition of Tech Titans (GCTT) - a conglomerate of all major tech companies led by Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Meta, and others. This patented technology became the crown jewel, and any use of Python lists required hefty licensing fees, filling the coffers of the already powerful corporations.

To enforce this, the GCTT painted a grand narrative: Lists were the epitome of efficiency and elegance, the ultimate data structure. All others were substandard. As a result, the use of deques with lists became the mainstream norm. It was profitable, it was popular, but for many, it wasn't efficient.

But not everyone was swayed by this corporate onslaught. In the underground world of data structures and algorithms, murmurs of a revolution began. The Resistance was born, a group of radical thinkers who believed in the power of doubly linked lists. They were the guardians of knowledge, the ones who saw through the corporate veil. To them, deques should be written using doubly linked lists, not the licensed, inefficient lists.

You, a fresh graduate with dreams and hopes, unknowingly walk into this whirlwind. Hired by a tech startup, Neoteric Nodes, you're introduced to its enigmatic CEO: S. Omsae, known in the Resistance circles as the "Deque Purist". The Resistance's battle wasn't just ideological; it was deeply personal for S. Omsae.

Your initiation was immediate. Handed the task of creating a better Circular Deque class, the stakes were clear: Use a list, and your career at Neoteric Nodes would be shorter than a list with a single element.

Your onboarding crew showed you their most important piece of work so far: The CDLL (Circular Doubly Linked List). Imperfect but revolutionary, it was the Resistance's answer to the Python list monopoly.

Throughout this project, you should help The Resistance by designing a Circular Deque that uses the CDLL as its underlying structure, which you decide to call the CDLLCD, as shown.
